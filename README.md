# Imperial College London Math Notes
This repository contains notes for Imperial College mathematics courses written in LaTeX. In these notes, I summarise important theorems and add my own understanding of the material. I will continue updating the notes as I progress through the courses.

If you spot any mistake or typo please contact me via emal tw1824@ic.ac.uk.
